Various implementations of linear regression models
Both single variate and multivariate

Single Variate is almost dead accurate as of right now
- Adjust Epoch and Learning rate to fit your data set
- Cost Function Graph should look like a negative sloping curve
- Basically the opposite graph of ln(x) is what you want to see for the cost function

Multivariate is still under construction so no guaruntees on that one
