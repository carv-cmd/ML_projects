What is a Greedy Algorithm?
How to identify the characteristics of a Greedy Algorithm?

Where are some areas we should use these algorithms?
And where are some places they produce less than optimal results?

Greedy Algorithms essentially just aim to reduce the problem size as much as possible with each step

Consider we have 3 coins of different values: [(1cent), (5cent), (10cent)]
These are the types of coins we can use and we have an unlimited amount of these coins

The question is then, given we need 47cent total..
-> What is the optimal solution when the goal..
--> Is to find the smallest possible combination of coins to get us to 47cent?
==> (10cent*4) + (5cent*1) + (1cent*2) = 47cent

Therefore can we find an algorithm that always gives us the optimal solution?

    def optimizer(x=1, y=5, z=10):
        result = []
        number = int(input('Enter Number: '))

        mod = number % z
        result.append(f'{(number - mod) // z}*(10cent)')
        number, mod = mod, number

        mod = number % y
        result.append(f'{(number - mod) // y}*(5cent)')
        number, mod = mod, number

        mod = number % x
        result.append(f'{number - mod // x}*(1cent)')

        return result

The above is an example of a greedy algorithm
Basically says: 'How can I decrease this value as much as possible with my next step?'
10 is the largest value we have so we start there

This isn't always the case where a greedy algorithm gives us the most optimal result

Consider a new set of coins: [1c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 25c]
With the same goal of finding optimal solutions

Given we need 40c in the least amount of coins
-> The optimal solution would be 2 20c coins

But with a greedy approach it will aim to reduce as much as possible in the first step
-> Therefore 25c will be subtracted from 40c with a remainder of 15c
--> Then 10c will be subtracted from 15c with a remainder of 5c
---> And 5c will be subtracted getting us to our total
