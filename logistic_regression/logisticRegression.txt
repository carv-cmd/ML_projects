Logistic Regression ~~ Classification Problems

Classification
 - Email: Spam / Not Spam ?
 - Online Transactions: Fraudulent (Yes/No) ?
 - Tumor: Malignant / Benign ?

We can therefore thing of Y ∈ {0, 1}.
Where:
 - 0: "Negative Class" (i.e.- benign tumor)
 - 1: "Positive Class" (i.e.- malignant tumor)

While the assignment of classes to +/- is kind of arbitrary
The unofficial convention/intuition is that:
 - 0:NegativeClass: indicates the absence of something we may be looking for
 - 1:PositiveClass: indicates the presence of something we may be looking for

Later on MultiClass Classification Problems will be covered
Where: Y ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}
Until then lets focus on the 'binary' classification problem Y ∈ {0, 1}

When thinking about how to model this problem well use the tumor example
Where:
- x-axis = TumorSize (range: small to large)
- y-axis = Malignant (range:   yes or no)

Linear Regression is inaccurate when trained on classification data sets
Since our data points are either a 1 or 0 this results in the requirement a binary output as well
With the Logistic Regression algorithm we can get prediction values between 1 or 0
Logistic Regression: 0 <= h_θ(x) <= 1
Also known as Logistic Classification

Hypothesis Representation for Logistical Regression
I.E.- What is the 'function' that were going to use to represent our hypothesis of classification problems

Logistic Regression Model
 Want: 0 <= h_θ(x) <= 1

Where we would like our classifier to output values between 0 and 1
So we want a hypothesis that satisfies this property where predictions are between 0 and 1
