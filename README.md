# ML_projects
Learning to use GitHub. 
Using this repository as a place to store and backup my ML/dataScience/algo code 

Maybe no one sees this. Maybe someone does.

No trade secrets here, yet. 
Therefore feel free to use any code snippets you find useful.
Unless you're a fortune 500, then we need to talk about licensing.

I know 'dont go reinventing the wheel', you can always copy paste someone elses code.
I try not to do that because its a terrible way to learn. 
Therefore, most of my code is 'from scratch'..
So please feel free to give me any tips or critque. Trust me I dont mind. 
I try to reference the documentation way more often then stack overflow. 
But where I do use others code I will give credit in that projects repository txt file.

Any advanced math, machine learning, or python, etc. seen here, 
was learnt from these resources:
* Khan Academy (math)
* MIT OpenCourseware (python and computer science)
* Andrew NG (machine learning/data science)
