How do we visualize data with Bar Charts using matplotlib?
Bar charts are simply graphs that display data with... bars

Begin by creating some tuples with values and assigning them to variables
Next create a list of elements which those values relate to (names in this case)

First we create an 'index' variable, this should be equal to the number of X values we have (names)
Calling np.index(4) just gives us an array with 4 values

Then to create our bar chart we call the plt.bar() function
When plotting values to our bar chart the first parameter we pass is the X
The x value should be the position of our person
Since we only have one value for the total skill level which is the sum of the 4 skill values
The skill level is relative to the persons name so they're indexed across the bottom
This X value will be the 'index' variable defined above
Using index justs says the first bar is at index n, second is at index n1, and so on

The Y value is the skill
For skills we provide the index, python variable, bar width, and a label for the legend
plt.bar(index, python, width=0.2, label='Python')
plt.bar(index + 0.2, java, width=0.2, label='Java')
plt.bar(index + 0.4, networking, width=0.2, label='Networking')
plt.bar(index + 0.6, machine_learning, width=0.2, label='Machine Learning')

The above just says were plotting 4 bars for each person
And every bar has to be shifted to the right the width of the bar
If you notice the index doesnt stay the same, instead we shift it the width of the bar so they dont overlap

Now that the barchart is full of values, we can add some styling
We can also add axis labels
As well as plt.xticks which are just our x value ticks (see code)
index + 2 is so the name is centered, and we just pass the people variable to have the names included in the chart

If the legend overlaps the chart values we can use plt.ylim(0, 120) as this adds more space at the top of chart
In addition to the extra space it keeps our bars proportioned as they have a limit reference
